#LanguageSwitcher: Some Basic SWIFT and UIKit Concepts
====================================================================================================

This sample uses the SWIFT programming language to look at how it integrates with UIKit and other NS* libraries. This example shows a few things:

1. IBOutlet and binding with a Storyboard
2. IBAction and binding with a Storyboard
3. Using an enumeration and an inline function to convert the enum to a string
4. NSBundle and loading resource files
5. Using tags and one event for several items
6. Using NSNotificationCenter
7. Using constant values
8. Fetching a property from the AppDelegate
9. Overriding the init with a Storyboard decoder
10. Creating a class (but) and deriving it from NSObject and using the init method
11. Casting a AnyObject variable to a specific type.

===========================================================================
